Control of stability of the y axis using a set of 4 motors to label a bed in 1 dimension; control of stability of the z and x axis with two motors that control the wheels.

For this project i´ve worked step by step, you can find the following files in this repository:

-FullCode_V1_2_AnalogVersion_fBed (controls only the stability of the bed with four motors attached to the bed).
-FullCode_V1_2_AnalogVersion_WheelControl (controls only the stability with the wheels as actuators).
-FullCode_V2 (both controls working together).
-sensor (checks how the sensor works and prints the values on the serial monitor).
-l298 (checks if the module and the motors work).
