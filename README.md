# Self-balance-car-system
Control of stability of the y axis using a set of 4 motors to stabilize a bed (which is situated above the chasis of the car) in 1 dimension; control of stability of the z and x axis with two motors that control the wheels of a car system.

For this project iÂ´ve worked step by step, you can find the following files in this repository:

-FullCode_V1_2_AnalogVersion_fBed (controls only the stability of the bed with four motors attached to the bed).  
-FullCode_V1_2_AnalogVersion_WheelControl (controls only the stability with the wheels as actuators).  
-FullCode_V2 (both controls working together).  
-sensor (checks how the sensor works and prints the values on the serial monitor).  
-checkI2C (checks if the I2C connection works well).  
-prueba_l298 (checks if the module and the motors work).
